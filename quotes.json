    "\t\"...Know you? I wonder do I know you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.\"\n\n\t\"To see my soul!\" muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and turning almost white from fear.\n\t\"Yes,\" answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his voice, \"to see your soul. But only God can do that.\"\n\n\tA bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. \"You shall see it yourself, to-night!\" he cried, seizing a lamp from the table. \"Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn't you look at it? You can tell the world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.\"\n\n\tThere was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that the man who painted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done.\n\n\t\"Yes,\" he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into his stern eyes, \"I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see.\"\n\n\t...\n\n\tThen he [Basil] straitened himself up, and walked over to the fireplace, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.\n\n\t\"I am waiting Basil,\" said the young man in a hard clear voice.\n\n\tHe turned round. \"What I have to say is this,\" he cried. \"You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are untrue from beginning to end, I shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian deny them!  Can't you see what i am going through? My God! Don't tell me that you are bad, and corrupt, and shameful.\"\n\n\tDorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. \"Come upstairs, Basil,\" he said quietly. \"I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall show it to you if you come with me.\"\n\n\t\"I shall come with you Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don't ask me to read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.\"\n\n\t\"That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You shall not have to read long.\n\n\t\t-The Picture of Dorian Grey-",

    "He would never again tempt by a prayer, any terrible power. If the picture was to alter it would alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it? For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer. When the blood crept from his face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamor of boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

    "Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some mourning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colors, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

    "[...] in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness gad monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled [...]\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

    "There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning - poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jeweled fan, by a lighted torch, by an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

    "There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fiber of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion to its fascination and fascination its charm. For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience. When that high spirit, that mourning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

    "Ah! In what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the unsullied splendor of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not \"forgive our sins\" but \"Smite us for our iniquities\" should be the prayer of man to a most just God.\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

    "She is very clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious.

    "Good God Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!\"\nThere was no answer, but he could hear the younger man sobbing at the window. \n\"Pray Dorian, pray,\" he murmured. \"What is it that one was taught to say in one's boyhood? 'Lead us not into temptation. Forgive our sins. Wash away our iniquities.' Let us say that together. The prayer of your pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be also. I worshiped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshiped yourself too much. We are both punished.\"\nDorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed eyes. \n\"It is too late, Basil \" he faltered.\n\n-The Picture of Dorian Grey",

And it is like bending back a stiff spring... it is by compulsion, that I do the slightest act, not prompted by one thought, and by compulsion, that I notice anything alive, or dead, which is not associated with the one universal idea... I have a single wish, and my whole being, and faculties are yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached - and soon - because it has devoured my existence - I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfillment.\nMy confessions have not relieved me - but, they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humor which I show.

Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.\n\n\t-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulu",

    "That is not dead which can eternal lie,\nAnd with strange aeons even death may die..\n\n\t-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulu",

    "The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\n\n\t-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulu",

    "\"I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives.\"\n\n\t-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulu",

    "Even the dry tips of the lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and the fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were unstirred. And yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving....\n\n\t-H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour Out of Space.",

    "Something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor, and something terrible — though I know not in what proportion — still remains.\n\n\t-H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour Out of Space"
